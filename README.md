ABM CBC pest-NE multicrop

The code is the result of my master 2 internship research project at the ESE lab. 
It is an agent based model that study the effects of the landscape spatio-temporal configuration on the pest regulation service provided by natural enemies.
We used the model aphid-ladybirds to calibrate it.
